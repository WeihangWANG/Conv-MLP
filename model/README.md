To verify the different overlap rates, you can change the number of patches parameter in `mixer.py`. Specifically, change the dimension 9 of the bottleneck layer to the corresponding number of patches, such as `mixer_16.py`. Also, you need to modify the way to split the image into patches in `../data/augmentation.py`.
